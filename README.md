## ðŸš€ Installation

Follow these steps to clone the repository and set up your Neovim configuration.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the **eVim** repository to your Neovim configuration directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erfankeyhani-1/EvimConf.git ~/.config/nvim
```

> **Note:** This command will overwrite your existing Neovim configuration. If you have important configurations, consider backing them up before proceeding.

### 2. Install Packer.nvim

**eVim** uses [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as the plugin manager. If you don't have `packer.nvim` installed, run the following command:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

### 3. Install Plugins

After cloning the repository and installing `packer.nvim`, open Neovim to install the necessary plugins:

```bash
nvim
```

Once Neovim is open, execute the following command to install all plugins:

```vim
:PackerSync
```

This command will download and set up all the plugins specified in the configuration.
